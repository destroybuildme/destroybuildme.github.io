<!-- Hey Mr. Fisch, after checking with my parents I noticed that this turned out much more like a job application than a resume. I forgot what a resume technically was. Hopefully it does justice in showing that I'm learning how to work with HTML and CSS.

 <p class = "formal"> To whom it may concern,</p>
 <p class = "normal"> All my life, I have been interested in a job cooking at Arby's. The idea of "eating fresh," and "lovin' it" have never quite satisfied my search for scrumptious food as much as <span class = "redbold">"we have the meats!"</span> You will find that I am mostly qualified for this job, as well, so I hope that you'll accept my labor with open arms.<br>I have managed to accumulate a GPA in high school (<a href = http://arapahoe.littletonpublicschools.net/ target="_blank">Arapahoe High School</a>, in fact), above the certainly remarkable 4.0 mark, important to my work because I am absolutely aware that a cook at Arby's is a <span class = "insert">prestigious, intellectual career</span> requiring experience with a rigorous, educated lifestyle. Don't worry, Arby's, I am prepared to handle this job!<br>Besides educational experience, I have a bit of cooking experience as well. My mother, a pretty good cook, and my father, a <span class = "italic">culinary instructor</span>, have taught me a couple of useful things in the kitchen. Of that which they've taught me, I have successfully mastered:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Toast</li>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>Sandwich</li>
 </ul>
 <p class = "normal">My deference for sandwich making has inspired me my whole life to work for a revered sandwich-producing institute such as that which you direct. I have made many glorious sandwiches, all complete with enough meat to satisfy a few wolves.<br>An image of one of my meaty sandwiches is provided here:</p>
 <p id = "image"><img src = "sandwich.JPG" style = "width:155px; height:204px"></p>
 <p class = "normal">Though I'm sure the application process to Arby's is competitive, I feel absolutely prepared for the job. I hope you'll consider my application seriously. I will make a great cook, I'm sure of it!</p>
 <p class = "formal"> Sincerely,</p>
